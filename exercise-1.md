# Exercise: making changes to make to the `tiny-web-page`

The page looks great, but the team has been asked to make some changes to make it even better!

Let's make these changes, each one in its own branch and pull request.

Remember to start each branch from `main`.

Prepare the pull requests, but don't merge them yet.

1. The background should be more blue. Let's change it to `rgb(30, 30, 55)`.
2. The background logo should be more transparent. Please set it to `opacity: 0.06`.
3. Please change the words "consisting of" to "made up of".
4. Change the first list to an *un*ordered list (`<ul>`).
5. Please reword "just 3 files" to "just three files".
6. Please change the background colour to green.
7. Add a CSS rule to indent the two lists, using `padding-left: 3em`.
8. Instead of calling it "tiny web page", let's instead say "small web page".
9. Wrap everything inside the body inside a `<div>`. Make sure to indent the file nicely.
10. Please fix the spelling mistake: "in the first plaice" should say "in the first place".
